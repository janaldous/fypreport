\chapter{Introduction}

Local government councils are challenged with providing services using limited resources. They also need to cater to a diverse population with different needs. Therefore, there is a need to create policies which efficiently utilize and allocate resources in the most effective way. \par

Using data science in policy decision making is gaining in popularity. Data science provides insights on trends and patterns about customer needs and behavior which may lead to policies to better cater to those needs. One technique to identify customer needs is customer segmentation which groups individuals with similar needs. This will let councils better understand the needs of segments of the population thus letting them tailor services to provide better services and identify groups which require the most attention. Clustering algorithms, which also group similar objects together, can automate the identification of segments which is especially useful when one deals with large data sets. Since it uses a similarity calculation, it could identify groups which have not been considered before. The national government and the Local Government Association have promoted customer segmentaion in local governments especially after budget cuts \cite{smartcities} \cite{lgaguide}. \par

The process of data analysis often involves technical skills since data analysis tools are sophisticated tools. Policy makers may not have these skills. This distances themselves from interacting and understanding the data.\par

This project aims to produce a software that allows policy makers in councils to explore the data themselves. This project aims to implement a prototype of such a tool as a Django web application.\par

The tool allows the user to create population groups and visualize data about them. Visualizations of this data will also help to compare characteristics of the group to the wider population and subgroups. This comparison may lead to observations on the circumstances a group is facing. This may lead to the conclusion that the council may want to increase or tailor resources allocated to a group or service. Since the user may not necessarily know what they are looking for when they view the data, the visualizations will be in the form that will let the user explore more aspects of the data. \par

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Chapter \ref{ch:background} introduces the concept of customer segmentation, clustering, data exploration and related work. Chapter \ref{ch:requirements} discusses the requirements of the tool. Chapter \ref{ch:design} outlines the specification and design of the tool. Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} describes how the tool was implemented. Chapter \ref{ch:professionalissues} discuses the professional and ethical issues. Chapter \ref{ch:evaluation} describes the results of the evaluation after the tool was demonstrated to members of the policy department. Lastly, chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} discuses the conclusions and future work of the project.
