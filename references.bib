Data exploration naturally begins when a user is given a set of data and ends when the user extracts all information and knowledge hidden in the data. Although a plethora of systems have been developed to tackle different data exploration aspects, there is no framework devoted to it as a whole. In this paper, we claim that "any" user-data interaction is essential for data exploration and sketch a prototype with both automated and user-induced functionality.},

For many applications, besides the mere graph data also further information about the vertices of a graph is available, which can be represented as attribute vectors. Recently, combined clustering approaches were introduced, which consider graph information and attribute vectors simultaneously for clustering. The visualization of clustering results can help users to get a better understanding of the results. In this paper, we introduce the {GC}-Viz system, which is implemented as a plugin for the Gephi platform. {GC}-Viz allows the user to test the combined clustering methods {GAMer} and {DB}-{CSC} on their data and to visualize and explore the clustering results. Furthermore, {GC}-Viz enables the user to visually compare the results of different clustering algorithms on the same dataset.},

	abstract = {In recent years many government organizations have implemented Open Government Data ({OGD}) policies to make their data publicly available. This data usually covers a broad set of domains, from financial to ecological information. While these initiatives often report anecdotal success regarding improved efficiency and governmental savings, the potential applications of {OGD} remain a largely uncharted territory. In this paper, we claim that there is an important portion of the population who could benefit from the use of {OGD}, but who cannot do so because they cannot perform the essential operations needed to collect, process, merge, and make sense of the data. The reasons behind these problems are multiple, the most critical one being a fundamental lack of expertise and technical knowledge. We propose the use of visualizations as a way to alleviate this situation. Visualizations provide a simple mechanism to understand and communicate large amounts of data. We also show evidence that there is a need for exploratory mechanisms to navigate the data and metadata in these visualizations. Finally, we provide a discussion on a set of features that tools should have in order to facilitate the creation of visualizations by users. We briefly present the implementation of these features in a new tool prototype focused on simplifying the creation of visualization based on Open Data.},
